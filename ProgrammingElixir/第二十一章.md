Linking Modules: Behavio(u)rs and Use




* * *



When we wrote our OTP server, we wrote a module that started with code

defmodule Sequence.Server do



use GenServer



...





In this chapter we’ll explore what lines such as use GenServer actually do, and how we can write modules that extend the capabilities of other modules that use them.





Behaviours


An Elixir behaviour is nothing more than a list of functions. A module that declares that it implements a particular behaviour must implement all of the associated functions. If it doesn’t, Elixir will generate a compilation warning.

A behaviour is therefore a little like an interface in Java. A module uses it to declare that it implements a particular interface. For example, an OTP GenServer should implement a standard set of callbacks (handle_call, handle_cast, and so on). By declaring that our module implements that behaviour, we let the compiler validate that we have actually supplied the necessary interface. This reduces the chance of an unexpected runtime error.





Defining Behaviours


We define a behaviour using the Elixir Behaviour module, combined with defcallback definitions.

For example, Elixir comes with a URI parsing library. This library delegates a couple of functions to protocol-specific libraries (so there’s a library for HTTP, one for FTP, and so on). These protocol-specific libraries must define two functions: parse and default_port.

The interface to these sublibraries is defined in a URI.Parser module. It looks like this:

defmodule URI.Parser do



@moduledoc """



Defines the behavior for each URI.Parser.



Check URI.HTTP for a possible implementation.



"""



use Behaviour





@doc """



Responsible for parsing extra URL information.



"""



defcallback parse(uri_info :: URI.Info.t) :: URI.Info.t





@doc """



Responsible for returning the default port.



"""



defcallback default_port() :: integer



end





This module defines the interface that modules implementing the behaviour must support. There are two parts to this. First, it has the line use Behaviour. This adds the functionality we need to define behaviours.

Next, it uses defcallback to define the functions in the behaviour. But the syntax looks a little different. That’s because we’re using a minilanguage: Erlang type specifications. For example, the parse function takes a single parameter, which should be a URI.Info record, and it returns a value of the same type. The default_port function takes no arguments and returns an integer. For more information on these type specifications, see Appendix 2, Type Specifications and Type Checking.

In addition to the type specification, we can include module and function-level documentation with our behaviour definitions.





Declaring Behaviours


Having defined the behaviour, we can declare that some other module implements it using the @behaviour attribute.

defmodule URI.HTTP do



@behaviour URI.Parser



def default_port(), do: 80



def parse(info), do: info



end





This module will compile cleanly. However, imagine we’d misspelled default_port:

defmodule URI.HTTP do



@behaviour URI.Parser





» def default_prot(), do: 80



def parse(info), do: info



end





When we compile the module, we’d get this error:

http.ex:8: undefined behaviour function default_port/0 (for behaviour URI.Parser)





Behaviours give us a way of both documenting and enforcing the public functions that a module should implement.





Use and __using__


In one sense, use is a trivial function. You pass it a module along with an optional argument, and it invokes the function or macro __using__ in that module, passing it the argument.

Yet this simple interface gives you a powerful extension facility. For example, in our unit tests we write use ExUnit.Case and we get the test macro and assertion support. When we write an OTP server, we write use GenServer and we get both a behaviour that documents the gen_server callback and default implementations of those callbacks.

Typically, the __using__ callback will be implemented as a macro, as it will be used to invoke code in the original module.





Putting It Together—Tracing Method Calls


Let’s work through a larger example. We want to write a module called Tracer. If we use Tracer in another module, entry and exit tracing will be added to any subsequently defined function. For example, given the following:

use/tracer.ex

defmodule Test do



use Tracer



def puts_sum_three(a,b,c), do: IO.inspect(a+b+c)



def add_list(list), do: Enum.reduce(list, 0, &(&1+&2))



end





Test.puts_sum_three(1,2,3)



Test.add_list([5,6,7,8])





we’d get this output:

==> call puts_sum_three(1, 2, 3)



6



<== returns 6



==> call add_list([5,6,7,8])



<== returns 26





My approach to writing this kind of code is to start by exploring what we have to work with, and then to generalize. The goal is to metaprogram as little as possible.

It looks as if we have to override the def macro, which is defined in Kernel. So let’s do that and see what gets passed to def when we define a method.

use/tracer1.ex

defmodule Tracer do



defmacro def(definition, do: _content) do



IO.inspect definition



quote do: {}



end



end





defmodule Test do



import Kernel, except: [def: 2]



import Tracer, only: [def: 2]





def puts_sum_three(a,b,c), do: IO.inspect(a+b+c)



def add_list(list), do: Enum.reduce(list, 0, &(&1+&2))



end





Test.puts_sum_three(1,2,3)



Test.add_list([5,6,7,8])





This outputs

{:puts_sum_three, [line: 15],



[{:a, [line: 15], nil}, {:b, [line: 15], nil}, {:c, [line: 15], nil}]}



{:add_list, [line: 16], [{:list, [line: 16], nil}]}



tracer1.ex:12: unused import Kernel



** (UndefinedFunctionError) undefined function: Test.puts_sum_three/3





The definition part of each method is a three-element tuple. The first element is the name, the second is the line on which it is defined, and the third is a list of the parameters, where each parameter is itself a tuple.

We also get an error: puts_sum_three is undefined. That’s not surprising—we intercepted the def that defined it, and we didn’t create the function.

You may be wondering about the form of the macro definition: defmacro def(definition, do: _content)…. The do: in the parameters is not special syntax: it’s simply a pattern match on the block passed as the function body, which is a keyword list.

You may also be wondering whether we have affected the built-in Kernel.def macro. The answer is no. We’ve created another macro, also called def, which is defined in the scope of the Tracer module. In our Test module we tell Elixir not to import the Kernel version of def but instead to import the version from Tracer. Shortly, we’ll make use of the fact that the original Kernel implementation is unaffected.

Now let’s see if we can define a real function given this information. That turns out to be surprisingly easy. We already have the two arguments passed to def. All we have to do is pass them on.

use/tracer2.ex

defmodule Tracer do



defmacro def(definition, do: content) do



quote do



Kernel.def(unquote(definition)) do



unquote(content)



end



end



end



end





defmodule Test do



import Kernel, except: [def: 2]



import Tracer, only: [def: 2]





def puts_sum_three(a,b,c), do: IO.inspect(a+b+c)



def add_list(list), do: Enum.reduce(list, 0, &(&1+&2))



end





Test.puts_sum_three(1,2,3)



Test.add_list([5,6,7,8])





When we run this, we see 6, the output from puts_sum_three.

Now it’s time to add some tracing.

use/tracer3.ex

defmodule Tracer do



def dump_args(args) do



args |> Enum.map(&inspect/1) |> Enum.join(", ")



end





def dump_defn(name, args) do



"#{name}(#{dump_args(args)})"



end





defmacro def(definition={name,_,args}, do: content) do



quote do



Kernel.def(unquote(definition)) do



IO.puts "==> call: #{Tracer.dump_defn(unquote(name), unquote(args))}"



result = unquote(content)



IO.puts "<== result: #{result}"



result



end



end



end



end





defmodule Test do



import Kernel, except: [def: 2]



import Tracer, only: [def: 2]





def puts_sum_three(a,b,c), do: IO.inspect(a+b+c)



def add_list(list), do: Enum.reduce(list, 0, &(&1+&2))



end





Test.puts_sum_three(1,2,3)



Test.add_list([5,6,7,8])





Looking good:

==> call: puts_sum_three(1, 2, 3)



6



<== result: 6



==> call: add_list([5,6,7,8])



<== result: 26





Now let’s package our Tracer module so clients only have to add use Tracer to their own modules. We’ll implement the __using__ callback. The tricky part here is differentiating between the two modules: Tracer and the module that uses it.

use/tracer4.ex

defmodule Tracer do





def dump_args(args) do



args |> Enum.map(&inspect/1) |> Enum.join(", ")



end





def dump_defn(name, args) do



"#{name}(#{dump_args(args)})"



end





defmacro def(definition={name,_,args}, do: content) do



quote do



Kernel.def(unquote(definition)) do



IO.puts "==> call: #{Tracer.dump_defn(unquote(name), unquote(args))}"



result = unquote(content)



IO.puts "<== result: #{result}"



result



end



end



end





defmacro __using__(_opts) do



quote do



import Kernel, except: [def: 2]



import unquote(__MODULE__), only: [def: 2]



end



end



end





defmodule Test do



use Tracer



def puts_sum_three(a,b,c), do: IO.inspect(a+b+c)



def add_list(list), do: Enum.reduce(list, 0, &(&1+&2))



end





Test.puts_sum_three(1,2,3)



Test.add_list([5,6,7,8])





Use use


Elixir behaviours are fantastic—they let you easily inject functionality into modules you write. And they’re not just for library creators—use them in your own code to cut down on duplication and boilerplate.

Although behaviours let you add to modules that you are writing, you sometimes need to extend the functionality of modules written by others—code that you can’t change. Fortunately, Elixir comes with protocols, the subject of the next chapter.





Your Turn


Exercise: LinkingModules-BehavioursAndUse-1

In the body of the def macro, there’s a quote block that defines the actual method. It contains IO.puts "==> call: #{Tracer.dump_definition(unquote(name), unquote(args))}"



result = unquote(content)



IO.puts "<== result: #{result}"





Why does the first call to puts have to unquote the values in its interpolation but the second call does not?



Exercise: LinkingModules-BehavioursAndUse-2

The built-in function IO.ANSI.escape will insert ANSI escape sequences in a string. If you put the resulting strings into a terminal, you can add colors and bold or underlined text. Explore the library, and then use it to colorize our tracing’s output.



Exercise: LinkingModules-BehavioursAndUse-3

(Hard) Try adding a method definition with a guard clause to the Test module. You’ll find that the tracing no longer works.Find out why.

See if you can fix it.
